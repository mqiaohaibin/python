"""
In Python, we can add single-line and multi-line Python comment.

Single-line comments begin with a pound (#) symbol and automatically
ends with an EOL (end of the line).

Multi-line comments are also known as block comments.

Using The Hash (#) Mark
To add multi-line comments, you should begin each line with the
pound (#) symbol followed by a single space. You can divide a comment into
paragraphs. Just add an empty line with a hash mark between each para.

Docstring In Python
Python has the documentation strings (or docstrings) feature.
You can define a docstring by adding it as a string constant. It must be the first 
statement. You can define a docstring with the help of triple-quotation mark. Add one in 
the beginning and second at the end of the string.

The strings defined using triple-quotation mark are docstring in Python. However, it might 
appear to you as a regular comment.
